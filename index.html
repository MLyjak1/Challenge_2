            <p tabindex="0">This is the first website I coded as part of my pre-work before the program began. This is not only an
                example of my experience with HTML and inline CSS, but also my initiative to learn new concepts and
                problem-solve independently</p>

            <h2 tabindex="0">Description:</h2>
            <p tabindex="0">This website was my first assignment when I started the program. It involved refacotring starter code to
                improve website efficiency and accessibility. It also required reformatting the CSS code for viewing on mobile
                devices.</p>

            <p tabindex="0">The purpose of this project is that a user will type a description of how they are feeling into a text
                box, and they will receive an output of possible emotions they are experiencing along with those
                emotion's definitions</p>

            <p tabindex="0">This webpage will take a given hex color code and attempt to convert it to a musical chord using the
                nearest matching guitar chords following certain parameters.  I may also try to reverse the process and have colors displayed based on chords played.</p>
